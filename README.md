# AutoTender Sovereign

## Mission
Automate the annotation, signing, and dispatch of remittance coupons as lawful instruments of tender. This project is designed to empower individuals to exercise their rights under the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) when settling debts.

## Core Modules
- `CouponAnnotator`: Adds payment details, signature, and legal citations to remittance coupons (PDFs or images).
- `CoverLetterGenerator` (Future): Drafts UCC-compliant letters citing tender laws.
- `LegalSupportFetcher` (Future): Scrapes and summarizes statutes and case law.

## Legal Basis
This tool operates on principles from the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) and other relevant regulations, including:
- **UCC § 3-104:** Negotiable Instrument
- **UCC § 3-204:** Endorsement
- **UCC § 3-409:** Acceptance
- **UCC § 3-603(b):** Tender Refusal
- **22 CFR § 23.2:** Federal Endorsement
- **Mailbox Rule** (Common Law)
- **IRS Publication 5137 & 1099-C**

## Usage
To use the `coupon_annotator.py` script, configure the `if __name__ == '__main__':` block with the path to your input file and the desired output path. The script will then generate an annotated image with a detailed legal endorsement.
